//! Tests for chatstate TTL (typing indicator expiry).
//!
//! The mock server's chatstate TTL is configurable via CHATSTATE_TTL_SECS env var
//! (default 30s). For fast tests, run the mock server with CHATSTATE_TTL_SECS=3.
//!
//! Separated into its own file so the TTL wait doesn't block other test files
//! (cargo runs test files in parallel, tests within a file sequentially).
